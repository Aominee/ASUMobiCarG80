Perhaps the greatest RC car project of all times.


## Basic System Components
- Car mechanics kit
- Arduino kit
- Battery
- Bluetooth communication module
- Sensors
- Bluetooth Terminal Software in Computer or Mobile

## Easy Driving Application
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in easy driving mode.
- User can control car movement using mobile.
- User can move the car forward, backward, left and right.
- The car should avoid obstacles. 
- The minimum requirements of obstacle avoidance is stop to avoid collision.
- Bonus, for better avoidance techniques.

## Line Tracking Application
- Students should prepare set of connected white sheets (2m x 2m) and draw track over it.
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in line tracking mode.
- When the car placed over the track it should follow the line.
- The minimum requirements is to use simple closed track.
- Bonus, for complex tracks with crossing points and sharp curves of radius less than 25 cm.

## Competition
- Track very complex track (4m x 4m) in minimum time for maximum number of turns.
- Line tracking technique must be accurate, especially at sharp edges.
- Car should move fast and steering mechanism also must be very efficient.
- Car battery should allow many turns, also, battery consumption should be minimized.
- Know that large battery, is heavy and may affect the speed, the maneuvering, and the tracking.
- 10 degrees for accurate tracking. 10 degrees for speed. 10 degrees for number of turns.

## Accurate Movement Application
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in accurate movement mode.
- Use can order the car to move forward or backward for certain length (EX 40 cm).
- Use can order the car to move right with proper angle (EX 30 degree).
- While demo the car should move in infinity shape then rectangle shape then circle shape.
- The car should return to beginning point after finishing each shape.
- The car should stop for 25 seconds after finishing each shape.
- The shape size must be (2m x 2m) no more no less.

## Advanced Applications (Bonus)
- Use GSM Shield to control car motion via mobile internet at open areas.
- Use WiFi Shield to control car motion via wifi internet at closed areas.
- Use GPS to retrieve car location at open areas.
- Use Camera and capture video stream from car to allow remote car driving.
- Use Camera and process image to avoid obstacles, recognize signs and avoid fall over.
- Integrate RF transmitter/receiver and make long distance remote control.
- Use multiple proximity sensors and implement auto park.
- Implement custom printed circuit board with Arduino chip and replace the driving board of existing car toy with smart one.
